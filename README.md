A simple wizard app that aids librarians in adding books to the library database.

It allows them to choose a book genre, sub-genre, adds a new sub-genre as well and 
fill out a form, detailing the information about the book to be added.

The project was built using react, redux (state management) and a library, react-toastify 
to notify the librarian of certain criteria that has to be met when filling the book
information.
